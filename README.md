Overview of Election Audit:
The purpose of this exercise was and is to analyze county voting data to determine who of the three congressional candidates won the most recent election and their total votes gained and the percentage of the total vote tally.  A secondary task of determining the breakdown of each of the three counties vote totals and their percentage of the total vote while showing the county with the largest turnout.  All of this was first printed to the terminal and then saved to a .txt file.
